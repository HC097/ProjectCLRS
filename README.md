# ProjectCLRS  

*A structured lecture series based on Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Steinâ€™s* **Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS).**  
This project organizes the text into a sequence of lectures to support deep understanding of algorithm analysis.  

---

## Purpose  

ProjectCLRS translates the canonical CLRS text into a **teachable lecture format**.  
The goal is not to replace the book, but to:  
- Structure its material into digestible lectures.  
- Provide commentary and emphasis on core algorithmic ideas.  
- Support rigorous, long-term mastery of algorithm analysis.  

This repository continues in the spirit of [Project Boyerâ€“Bach](https://github.com/HC097/ProjectBoyerBach): building **structured codices of knowledge** from canonical texts.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Scope  

- Covers the entirety of CLRS (4th Edition).  
- Each lecture includes:  
  - Summary of key concepts  
  - Proof sketches and algorithm derivations  
  - Selected exercises and walkthroughs  
- Additional commentary highlights connections across chapters.
