# ProjectCLRS  

*A structured lecture series based on Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein‚Äôs* **Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS).**  
This project organizes the text into a sequence of lectures to support deep understanding of algorithm analysis.

## Purpose  

ProjectCLRS translates the canonical CLRS text into a **teachable lecture format**.  
The goal is not to replace the book, but to:  
- Structure its material into digestible lectures.  
- Provide commentary and emphasis on core algorithmic ideas.  
- Support rigorous, long-term mastery of algorithm analysis.
