# ProjectCLRS  

*A structured lecture series based on Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein’s* **Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS).**  
This project organizes the text into a sequence of lectures to support deep understanding of algorithm analysis.  

---

## 📖 Purpose  

ProjectCLRS translates the canonical CLRS text into a **teachable lecture format**.  
The goal is not to replace the book, but to:  
- Structure its material into digestible lectures.  
- Provide commentary and emphasis on core algorithmic ideas.  
- Support rigorous, long-term mastery of algorithm analysis.  

This repository continues in the spirit of [Project Boyer–Bach](https://github.com/HC097/ProjectBoyerBach): building **structured codices of knowledge** from canonical texts.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure  

- `lectures/` – Chapter-by-chapter lecture notes  
- `examples/` – Worked examples and problem walkthroughs  
- `syllabus/` – Suggested study sequences and reading schedules  
- `resources/` – Supplementary references (papers, notes, links)  

---

## 🎯 Scope  

- Covers the entirety of CLRS (4th Edition).  
- Each lecture includes:  
  - Summary of key concepts  
  - Proof sketches and algorithm derivations  
  - Selected exercises and walkthroughs  
- Additional commentary highlights connections across chapters.  

---

## 🚀 Usage  

- Clone this repo and follow the `syllabus/` to track lectures in sequence.  
- Use `lectures/` for structured study.  
- Apply `examples/` to practice problem-solving.
